<h1>Simple-Sudoku-Solver</h1>

<h4>
A simple javascript-only sudoku solver. Uses recursion to iterate through every legal move until a solution is found.

It's not speed optimised and it can take some time (~30 seconds) with very hard sudokus. But most it solves in less than 1 second.

Not yet made mobile-friendly.

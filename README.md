# Simple-Sudoku-Solver

A simple javascript-only sudoku solver. Uses recursion to iterate through every legal move until a solution is found.

It's not speed optimised and it can take some time (~30 seconds) with very hard sudokus. But most it solves in less than 1 second.

Not yet made mobile-friendly.

Made in December 2017.
